- 👋 Hi, I’m Anna
- 👀 I’m a traditional and digital artist and also I'm into new and interesting forms of creation (but not only ;).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css and JavaScript and doing CS50x from Harvard
- 💞️ I love to do some Front end (I guess this is my artistic side) but also am all in when it comes to tinker with functionality
- 📫 If you are interested in collaboration or just to chat message me on Twitter or email
